    "**Submission Instructions:**\n",
    "1. **Primary Submission (GitHub Classroom):**  \n",
    "   You are encouraged to submit your homework through GitHub Classroom. This will allow you to collaborate on coding, version control, and peer reviews more efficiently. The repository for this assignment can be accessed through the provided GitHub Classroom link. Please make sure to commit and push your changes before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Submission (Blackboard):**  \n",
    "   If you prefer not to use GitHub Classroom, you can submit your completed assignment on Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backup Submission (Email):**  \n",
    "   In case you encounter any technical issues with either platform, you may submit your work via email as a last resort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, timely completion of assignments is crucial for your understanding of the course material. If you face any challenges, don't hesitate to reach out."
